The answer is All free adult males Thus for the militia to be wellregulated meaning in good working order the right of the people to keep and bear arms must not be infringed If it were infringed then the militia couldnt be in good working order because it might be not armed to begin with This amendment wasnt enacted in a vacuum It was passed at the end of a long and brutal war for independence part of which was a civil war between patriots and loyalists In that war the British tried and failed to disarm the colonists The drafters of the second amendment had this in the front of their minds when they wrote the language It seems awkward today because it misses some connector words that would be included in modern syntax and because regulated has taken on a different meaning as government has taken on more activities Still we have to look at the text of the 2nd and its meaning when written When it was written well regulated had nothing whatsoever to do with government regulation It referred to a wellfunctioning militia which consisted of at the time the entire male population who werent slaves The 13th and 14th amendments removed the slavery issue and changes in the role of women and many court decisions surrounding it have expanded the militia to include all adult women Bottom line?
